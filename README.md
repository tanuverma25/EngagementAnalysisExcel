## Project Overview
This project analyzes user engagement patterns based on minutes watched across various groups of students (free-plan and paying) and different time periods (Q4 2021 and Q4 2022). The objective was to uncover insights into engagement trends and regional differences to inform strategic decisions and product localization efforts.
## Key Features
Descriptive Statistics: Summarized engagement data to understand central tendencies and variability.
Confidence Intervals: Estimated engagement levels with 95% confidence for various groups.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducted two-sample t-tests assuming unequal variances to compare engagement patterns across time periods and regions (US vs. India).
## Tools and Techniques
Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, statistical calculations, and visualization.
Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and t-tests.
## Results and Findings
Engagement Trends: Engagement (minutes watched) was significantly higher in Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021 for both free-plan and paying students.
Regional Analysis: Indian students on the free plan watched more minutes on average than US students in 2022.
Subscription Impact: Paying students consistently demonstrated higher engagement levels than free-plan students across both periods.
## Conclusion.
This project highlights proficiency in Excel for statistical analysis and provides actionable insights into user behavior, supporting data-driven decisions for product and strategy improvements.
